    "Compound interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods. It's often called 'interest on interest.' The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is principal, r is annual rate, n is compounding frequency, and t is time in years.",
    "Stocks represent ownership shares in a corporation, giving holders potential voting rights and dividends. Bonds are debt instruments where investors loan money to entities in exchange for periodic interest payments and principal return at maturity. Stocks offer growth potential but higher risk, while bonds provide stable income with lower risk.",
    "Risk diversification involves spreading investments across different assets to reduce exposure to any single asset. The principle is that different investments will perform differently under various conditions, so losses in some may be offset by gains in others. This reduces portfolio volatility without necessarily sacrificing returns.",
    "Inflation erodes purchasing power, meaning money buys less over time. For savings, inflation reduces real value if interest rates don't keep pace. For investments, moderate inflation can be positive for stocks (companies can raise prices) but negative for fixed-income investments (fixed payments lose value).",

Investors own shares representing part of the fund's holdings, providing instant diversification and professional management.",
