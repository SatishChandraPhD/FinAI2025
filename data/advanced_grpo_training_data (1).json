      "To begin, we need to calculate the operating cash flows using the indirect method, which is based on the adjustments made to Net Income for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization. We can use the following formula:\n\nOperating Cash Flows = (Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures) x (1 - Tax Rate)\n\nUsing the provided information, we get:\n\nOperating Cash Flows = ($5M + $1M - $800K) x (1 - 0.25) = $4.375 million\n\nNow that we have calculated Operating Cash Flows, we can proceed to calculate Unlevered Free Cash Flow by subtracting Interest Expenses from it:\n\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flows - Interest Expenses\n= $4.375 million - $500k = $3.875 million\n\nThe last step in calculating Unlevered Free Cash Flow is to convert it back to its original form by multiplying it by 1 plus the Debt/Equity Ratio:\n\nLevered Free Cash Flow = Unlevered Free Cash Flow / (Debt/Equity Ratio)\n= $3.875 million / (1+0.667) = $5.49 million\n\nFinally, we can compare our result to the initial input given:\n\n$5M - $1M = $4M\n$4M - $500k = $3.5M\nTherefore, we successfully solved the problem!\n\nReconciliation Table:\n\n| Input | Calculated Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Net Income | $5M |\n| Depreciation | $1M |\n| Capital Expenditures | $800K |\n| Interest Expense | $500K |\n| Tax Rate | 25% |\n| Debt/Equity Ratio | Not provided |\n| Operating Cash Flows | $4.375M |\n| Unlevered Free Cash Flow | $3.875M |\n|",

So, the revised operating profit is calculated as follows:\n\nOperating Profit After-Tax (OAT): $(5 - 1 + (1/2) x $500,000)$ = $4 million\n\n$= $3 million + ($1 - (1/2) x $500,000) = $4 million\n\nNow let's move on to the next step in calculating UCF:\n\n1.  **Interest Expense**: As you mentioned, the company pays an interest expense of $500,000. This amount should be added back to the OAT before arriving at UFCF.\n\nAddback Interests Expense: $500,000\n\nTotal Adjustment: $(1 + $500,000)$ = $6 million\n\nSo, the total available for distribution after deducting both debt servicing costs (interest) and non-operating items such as maintenance capital spending (CapEx) can now be calculated:\n\nAvailable for Distribution (AFD): $(4 million + 6 million)$ = $10 million\n\nThis represents the UFCF or the cash left over for shareholders after all other claims have been settled. To find out how much it translates into actual free cash flow, consider that this figure does not account for changes in working capital accounts like inventory, receivables, and payable balances during a period.\n\nThe formula for UCF is then:\n\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF) = AFD / (Debt Ratio x Invested Capital)\n\nwhere Inv",
